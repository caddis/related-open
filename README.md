# ExpressionEngine Related Open 1.0.2

This extension adds links to related items in ExpressionEngine's native multi-relationship field.

## Installation And Use

To use, extract and put the related_open directory in your system third_party directory. Navigate to the ExpressionEngine extensions area and enable Related Open.

That's all there is to it. Relationship fields that allow multiple relationships will now display links to open the entry when hovering over an item.
